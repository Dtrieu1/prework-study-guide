# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? I was motivated to better understanding the underlying process of building products through coding. 
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") I built this project to provide a more hands on experience to better learn the material. There is one thing to learn it conceptually, but another to go through the process. 
- What problem does it solve? This solves our basic understanding on how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript help work together to build a better a user experience. The console provided an interesting understanding on what can be done behind the scenes too. 
- What did you learn? I learned quite a bit in the interaction of github on when we code. The relationship between one's local computer to the github took some time to get use to and the prework continued to provide us opportunities to begin getting use to this. 

## Usage

The Prework Study Guide provides insight on the importance in understanding the foundation of coding. This guide provided the building blocks for us to see how HTML, CSS, and Javascript works together. We first started working on HTML to formulate the foundation of our code. CSS gives the aesthetics and style that connects with the work we did for HTML. Javascript helps us make it more dynamic when the user begins interacting with the work we are building. In addition, we also get to learn about version control and storing our progress through the usage of Git and Github. The breakdowns in the guide provides us a nice introduction on what coding can create!
